          Starting my tech journey with a knack for design, I immersed myself in
          coding throughout my Computer Science Bachelor&#39;s program.
          Currently in my second year, I&#39;ve self-taught beyond the
          classroom, tackling software and full-stack projects. Now, with a
          better understanding of coding, combined with my love for design,
          I&#39;m looking forward to what I can create next.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I&#39;m always ready to learn more and work on exciting projects.
          Letâ€™s build something great together! ðŸš€
