        <p>
          Starting my tech journey with a knack for design,I dove into
          coding throughout my Computer Science Bachelor&#39;s program.<br />
          Currently in my second year,I&#39;ve self-taught beyond the
          classroom,<br /> tackling software and full-stack projects.<br /> Now, with a
          better understanding of coding,<br />combined with my love for design,<br />
          I&#39;m looking forward to what I can create next.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I&#39;m always ready to learn more and work on exciting projects.
          <br />
          Letâ€™s build something great together! ðŸš€
